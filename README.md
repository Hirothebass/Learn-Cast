# Learn-Cast
The official repository for Learn@Cast, the definitive ILC - Integrated Learning Center

There is always a new version in work, so let's start with some new information here.

This readme will be updated as soon as it has new relevant information, by now I'm just testing how fast I can type on my low-quality keyboard.

I'm not a DEV myself, but my true intention here is to learn a little bit of programming and coding, as well as UX and front-end concepts. The reason is pretty simple: I'm not really satisfied with the LMS options we have at the moment. I was a manager at a local restaurant and had some projects made on excel, so I know just a little bit of coding and some logical syntaxes. Now, I'm a teacher who works a lot in order to get new English students for my digital classes.

TLDR: I'm a teacher who's frustrated with my professional life, so wants to develop an app for teaching English and (hopefully) get a living with that.
